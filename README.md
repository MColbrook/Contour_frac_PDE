# Contour_frac_PDE
Code for solving time-fractional PDEs

Based on the paper [1] Matthew J. Colbrook and Lorna J. Ayton, "A contour method for time-fractional PDEs and an application to fractional beam equations".

Currently two scripts: frac_beam_quad.m performs the inverse Laplace transform via quadrature, Example_code.m runs an example from the paper (input parameters are labelled and self-explanatory).
